Title: Cookie Tar Pits

Do you like to play Cookie Clicker? It's kinda vice of mine. I've been working on my game for quite a while, unlocked all the stuff, making trillions of cookies per second. I've got my game saved in this file on my server:
/home/awesomeperson/important_files/cookie_clicker.txt
Whew boy! Hours of work down the drain if I were to lose that file, believe you me!

Anywho, can you send me some memes? I got a webpage to accept tarballs of memes. I wrote it in python!
